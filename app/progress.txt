Using this file to now track progress and set agendas for work sessions 
Tasks:

Goal is to get structued json output of a list of song names that can be searched using the spotify endpoint to get their uris and then add them to a playlist

1. Enable function calling for open ai 
2. create an agent with open ai 
3. prompt the model to perform the operation of searching for underground songs based on location 
4. Define function that can output songs in a json string 
5. parse json string 
6. loop through the uris and use pydantic base model to extract structured output
7. take each unique uri and add it to a playlist
